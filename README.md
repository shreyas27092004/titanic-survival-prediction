# Titanic Survival Prediction Web App

An interactive web application that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic. This project allows users to upload a passenger dataset in CSV format and receive real-time survival predictions based on a pre-trained machine learning model. The front-end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend is powered by Python and Flask.

## Features

- **Interactive File Upload:** Drag-and-drop or click to upload a CSV dataset.
- **Real-Time Prediction:** The app uses a simplified logistic regression model in JavaScript for instant client-side predictions.
- **Data Analysis Summary:** View key metrics, including the total number of passengers, predicted survivors, and predicted deceased.
- **Detailed Results Table:** See a passenger-by-passenger breakdown of survival predictions and probabilities.
- **Responsive Design:** A clean, modern UI that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Light & Dark Mode:** Toggle between themes for comfortable viewing.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS for utility classes)
- JavaScript (for DOM manipulation, file handling, and client-side prediction)

**Backend (Placeholder/Example):**
- Python 3

## Setup and Deployment

### Option 1: Run as a Static Site (No Backend)
This is the simplest method and uses the client-side JavaScript model.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
   **That's it!**

### Option 2: Deploy to Render

You can easily deploy the front-end as a Static Site on Render.

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. On the Render dashboard, click **New +** â†’ **Static Site**.
3. Connect your GitHub repository.
4. Set the **Publish Directory** to `.` (the root directory).
5. Click **Create Static Site**. Render will automatically deploy your `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files.

## Dataset

This project is designed to work with the **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster** dataset, available on Kaggle. The model was trained on features like `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, and `Fare` from this dataset.

* **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
* **Inspiration:** The analysis approach is inspired by public notebooks, such as *Exploring Survival on the Titanic* by Megan Risdal.
